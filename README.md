About Me Project 
Week 1

This is an About Me page created during week 1 of code course 201 at Source Code based in Ten Habitat, Bridgetown Barbados. Lessons from Code Fellows based in Seattle. 

This project is to practice and display the skills I have and am developing in html, css & javascript. 

Lab 2 : Create the page. Basic html structure, add in CSS and a game with 5 questions using JavaScript. 

Lab 3: Add in question 6 and 7, which are a bit more complex. 

Lab 4: Create a function to run the questions.
