          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <br>
            <p>I was born and grew up on this beautiful little island of Barbados. Playing at the beach every Sunday, and always wanting to be outside. Fast forward many years and I enjoy any new adventurous sports I learn about. But don't let that fool you, I am way more introverted than you would think after meeting me just once. I like time to sit quietly with my own thoughts and recharge. I like puzzles and algebra. Kakuro more than Sudoku. I like having little problems to solve, keeping my mind completely involved and closed off to all the distractions that would otherwise come regularly. To accomplish this the best way possible, I am learning to code.</p>
            <p>This page is one of the first of many projects to come. It displays my current knowledge of html, css and javascript while also displaying my taste of simplicity. Behind the scenes I am also getting a lot of needed practice using the command line and github. What seemed extremely intimidating to me just days ago, is quickly becoming comfortable and fun. But this is just the beginning.</p> 
            <p>I hope you enjoy getting to know me as you make your way through this page. I'm generally a pretty private person until I get to know you. Please feel welcome to checkout my github and reach out to me. I deeply appreciate any thoughts or feedback you may have to share.</p>
